Working on:



Need to:
Change all script to:
1. take parameters and the run the right script. This also will delete the individual scripts. all, run, jar, compile
2. each script depends on the ones before it.
3. take a option --single which only runs the one you give it.

Remove all trailing whitespace

Ideas:
Add key movement. You can use the guy's code for this.
