How to add a Flight Pattern

1. Create the Flight Pattern code in a class file which implements
FlightPattern. For examples look at the already written patterns.
2. Add a radio button in the visualizer around line 44. You need both a
initialization and a set action command. Also up the numButtons variable
one.
3. In the TKeyBehaviour constructor add an else if for your action
command and class name.
